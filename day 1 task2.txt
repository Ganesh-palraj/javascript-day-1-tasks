OBJECTS IN JavaScript

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.It is one of the most important data-type in 
javascript. An object is called a reference data type as it is a reference to where the data is stored.It is different 
from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol)  Objects in JavaScript may 
be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types.

OBJECTS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION 

They are stored in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties 
and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life.
The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects.
Example:
let a employee be that particular object.

OBJECTS AND PROPERTIES

A JavaScript object has properties associated with it.The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.
You can define a property by assigning it a value. You access the properties of an object with dot notation.

An example of the employee object is as follows:

employee= {
    "name": "Opal Kole",
   " salary"= 15000; 
    "allowance" = 1300;
    }

to access individual values in the object we can use the key value pair as follows
employee.name for accessing name,
 else to access as salary use employee.salary

Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation

example:
employee["name"]="opal kole"
employee["salary"]= 15000
employee[ "allowance"]=1300
