 A blog on Difference between HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
1. It is used for exchanging files on the world wide web.
2. It runs on top of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol).

                          Differences of 
HTTP/1.1                                                      HTTP/2

1. HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997              1.  HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.
                                            
2. HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other,   2. HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple 
so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks        streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other 
all the other resources behind it.                    resource. 

3. HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses  3. HTTP/2 splits the data into binary-code messages and numbering these 
in the plain text message form.                       messages so that the client knows which stream each binary message 
                                                      belongs to.

4. Head of line blocking in which TCP connection   4. HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that
It is blocked all other requests until the             eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets
responsedoes not receive. all the information  
related to the header file is repeated in every 
request.                                                      

5. In HTTP/1.1 server only serves content to a      5.The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the 
client device if the client asks for it.              request of the client using the PUSH frame.
